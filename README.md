This project investigates the potential of using social media usage patterns and demographic data to predict the risk of depression in individuals. Following the CRISP-DM methodology, a survey-based dataset smmh.csv was analyzed, containing self-reported information on age, gender, relationship status, social media habits, and mental health indicators.

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and selecting the most relevant variables using a Random Forest-based feature selection technique. Three models were trained and evaluated: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression (as a baseline). The models were compared using multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

The results showed that the Random Forest and Decision Tree models achieved comparable performance, with the Decision Tree offering greater interpretability. The study highlights the importance of feature selection and model evaluation in the context of mental health prediction. Future improvements could include handling class imbalance, exploring more advanced models, and validating results on external datasets.
